            <h1 class="display-3">My Awesome Cart</h1>
            <p>My Awesome Cart Pvt Ltd. is an Indian electronic commerce company based in Bengaluru, India. Founded by
                Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007, the company initially focused on book sales, before expanding
                into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.

                The service competes primarily with Amazon' s Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6]
                as of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart is
                significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of
                Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of
                electronics and mobile phones.[8] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the
                Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

                In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16
                billion, valuing it at $22 billion.</p>
